	<h2> Will I get bored on a cruise? </h2>
	<p> People usually always have the same assumptions about cruises, there are only so many things to do on a floating city. True, but with the amount of things
		these ships have to offer, you won't have time to do everything you'd like to do on the ship. With the top decks dedicated to sports such as basketball, ping pong, mini-golf and more, the inside
		decks have much more adult friendly places. This is where the casinos are, many bars, auditoriums for shows they have, and tons more. Kids will also be able to go to the arcades, as long as have ice cream 24/7! The buffets are endless, with pretty good food. Pizza and ice cream are available all day, every day. Movie nights are also a huge thing for cruises, where after the pools on the top deck are closed, they play a movie so you can relax and watch the stars while watching the movie as well. One of my favorite things to do! </p>
