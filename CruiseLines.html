<h2>Which Cruise Line Should you Decide on?</h2>
<p>There are tons of different options when it comes to deciding if you want to sail with either Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Disney, or so many other options. And within these different cruise lines, they travel different places and have different opportunities.</p>

<p> To start off, I'll begin with the ones that I have experienced. Carnival, Royal Caribbean, and Disney. 

<h3> Carnival Cruise Lines </h3>
	<p> The first cruise I ever experienced. This is the standard budget and price when it comes to cruises. Very luxury, but won't break the bank. As being as young as I was, I could not experience the 'full affect' of all the packages they had to offer, but from what I saw they serve good drinks. Rooms are just about as you expect for a cruise ship, enough space for the amount of time you spend in there. Most time is spent out of the cabin doing the tons of things the ship has to offer. That is covered in the <a href="Activities.html">Activities page!</a> </p>
<h4> Royal Caribbean </h4> 
	<p> My personal favorite! Rooms were a bit more spacious than other cruise lines, prices were also a bit more than others. As it goes noticed, the amentities the ship has to offer is unbelievable. The ships size, will blow you away. If you're looking to spend a bit more money, this is the one for you!</p>
<h5> Disney Cruise </h5>
	<p> Every kids dream! This cruise is awesome for children, and people who are interested in Disney. They offer tons of things for kids to do, along with almost everything on the ship Disney themed! Pricing is not too crazy, this is along the same lines as Carnival, though Disney themed.</p>
