	<h2> My Goal for You </h2>
	<p> I have designed this website to help fellow people gain more knowledge about cruise ships! Whether you are looking to go on a vacation with family or friends, or just want to learn more about what these awesome ships have to offer, this is the place for you! All information on this site is based on my past experiences with cruises, and some facts from each individual cruise line. I will also post images I have taken myself from my cruises, to give everyone a first hand experience of what a ship is really like! Here is a list of the main topics I will be covering, the essentials for picking a solid cruise vacation!</p>
